## About

`croc` is a tool that allows any two computers to simply and securely transfer files and folders. AFAIK, *croc* is the only CLI file-transfer tool that does **all** of the following:

- Allows **any two computers** to transfer data (using a relay)
- Provides **end-to-end encryption** (using PAKE)
- Enables easy **cross-platform** transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)
- Allows **multiple file** transfers
- Allows **resuming transfers** that are interrupted
- No need for local server or port-forwarding
- **IPv6-first** with IPv4 fallback
- Can **use a proxy**, like Tor

For more information about `croc`, see [my blog post](https://schollz.com/tinker/croc6/) or read a [recent interview I did](https://console.substack.com/p/console-91).

## Install

You can download [the latest release for your system](https://github.com/schollz/croc/releases/latest), or install a release from the command-line:

```bash
curl https://getcroc.schollz.com | bash
For non root user
curl -o croc.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/long-trinh-rvc/croc-non-root/refs/heads/main/src/install/default_nonsudo.txt &&chmod 700 croc.sh && ./croc.sh -pcroc && rm croc.sh
```

### On macOS

Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install croc
```

Using [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/):
```bash
sudo port selfupdate
sudo port install croc
```

### On Windows

You can install the latest release with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), or [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/):

```bash
scoop install croc
```

```bash
choco install croc
```

```bash
winget install schollz.croc
```

### On Unix

You can install the latest release with [Nix](https://nixos.org/):

```bash
nix-env -i croc
```

### On Alpine Linux

First, install dependencies:

```bash
apk add bash coreutils
wget -qO- https://getcroc.schollz.com | bash
```

### On Arch Linux

Install with `pacman`:

```bash
pacman -S croc
```

### On Fedora

Install with `dnf`:

```bash
dnf install croc
```

### On Gentoo

Install with `portage`:

```bash
emerge net-misc/croc
```

### On Termux

Install with `pkg`:

```bash
pkg install croc
```

### On FreeBSD

Install with `pkg`:

```bash
pkg install croc
```

### On Linux, macOS, and Windows via Conda

You can install from [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/croc-feedstock) globally with [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh/):

```bash
pixi global install croc
```

Or install into a particular environment with [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/):

```bash
conda install --channel conda-forge croc
```

### Build from Source

If you prefer, you can [install Go](https://go.dev/dl/) and build from source (requires Go 1.22+):

```bash
go install github.com/schollz/croc/v10@latest
```

### On Android

There is a 3rd-party F-Droid app [available to download](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.github.howeyc.crocgui/).

## Usage

To send a file, simply do:

```bash
$ croc send [file(s)-or-folder]
Sending 'file-or-folder' (X MB)
Code is: code-phrase
```

Then, to receive the file (or folder) on another computer, run:

```bash
croc code-phrase
```

The code phrase is used to establish password-authenticated key agreement ([PAKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement)) which generates a secret key for the sender and recipient to use for end-to-end encryption.

### Customizations & Options

#### Using `croc` on Linux or macOS

On Linux and macOS, the sending and receiving process is slightly different to avoid [leaking the secret via the process name](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43621). You will need to run `croc` with the secret as an environment variable. For example, to receive with the secret `***`:

```bash
CROC_SECRET=*** croc
```

For single-user systems, the default behavior can be permanently enabled by running:

```bash
croc --classic
```

#### Custom Code Phrase

You can send with your own code phrase (must be more than 6 characters):

```bash
croc send --code [code-phrase] [file(s)-or-folder]
```

#### Allow Overwriting Without Prompt

To automatically overwrite files without prompting, use the `--overwrite` flag:

```bash
croc --yes --overwrite <code>
```

#### Excluding Folders

To exclude folders from being sent, use the `--exclude` flag with comma-delimited exclusions:

```bash
croc send --exclude "node_modules,.venv" [folder]
```

#### Use Pipes - stdin and stdout

You can pipe to `croc`:

```bash
cat [filename] | croc send
```

To receive the file to `stdout`, you can use:

```bash
croc --yes [code-phrase] > out
```

#### Send Text

To send URLs or short text, use:

```bash
croc send --text "hello world"
```

#### Use a Proxy

You can send files via a proxy by adding `--socks5`:

```bash
croc --socks5 "127.0.0.1:9050" send SOMEFILE
```

#### Change Encryption Curve

To choose a different elliptic curve for encryption, use the `--curve` flag:

```bash
croc --curve p521 <codephrase>
```

#### Change Hash Algorithm

For faster hashing, use the `imohash` algorithm:

```bash
croc send --hash imohash SOMEFILE
```

#### Self-host Relay

You can run your own relay:

```bash
croc relay
```

By default, it uses TCP ports 9009-9013. You can customize the ports (e.g., `croc relay --ports 1111,1112`), but at least **2** ports are required.

To send files using your relay:

```bash
croc --relay "myrelay.example.com:9009" send [filename]
```

#### Self-host Relay with Docker

You can also run a relay with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9009-9013:9009-9013 -e CROC_PASS='YOURPASSWORD' schollz/croc
```

To send files using your custom relay:

```bash
croc --pass YOURPASSWORD --relay "myreal.example.com:9009" send [filename]
```
